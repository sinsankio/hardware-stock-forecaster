### Development Environment Setup

#### For Notebook Implementations:
1. Ensure Python 3.10 or later is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks located in the `notebooks/` directory to explore data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.

#### For App Execution:
1. Navigate to the `app/` directory.
2. Run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the forecasting application.

## Core Functionalities

### Predictive Analysis with ARIMA and SARIMA Models
The project leverages ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting. The implementation includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a stationary format suitable for ARIMA modeling.
- **Model Training**: Using historical stock price data to train ARIMA/SARIMA models.
- **Forecasting**: Generating future stock price predictions based on trained models.

### Implementation Highlights
- **Notebooks**: The `notebooks/` directory contains detailed workflows for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model selection.
- **App**: The `app/` directory hosts a web-based application for real-time stock price forecasting.
- **Exports**: Forecast reports are saved as PDFs in the `exports/` directory for easy sharing and analysis.
